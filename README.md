# Computational Physics PHYS250
This is a python-based course on computational physics at Siena College.  The course is typically taken by sophomore physics, astrophysics, and applied physics majors.

### Description
Methods of computer simulation and its diverse applications are introduced. The course is project-oriented; projects include the motion of massive and charged particles, chaotic systems, and random systems. Methods include the numerical solution of differential equations, fast Fourier transforms, and Monte Carlo techniques.

### Pre-Requisites:
* General Physics I
* Calculus I
* Prior coding course, such as Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization (SCDV 110) or CSIS 110

### Textbook

The course will follow the Giordano and Nakanishi text *Computational Physics*.
