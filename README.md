# Computational Physics PHYS250
This is a python-based course on computational physics at Siena College.  The course is typically taken by sophomore physics, astrophysics, and applied physics majors.

### Description
Methods of computer simulation and its diverse applications are introduced. The course is project-oriented; projects include the motion of massive and charged particles, chaotic systems, and random systems. Methods include the numerical solution of differential equations, fast Fourier transforms, and Monte Carlo techniques.

### Pre-Requisites:
* General Physics I
* Calculus I
* Prior coding course, such as Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization (SCDV 110) or CSIS 110

### Textbook

The course will follow parts of the Giordano and Nakanishi text <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computational-Physics-2nd-Nicholas-Giordano/dp/0131469908/ref=sr_1_1?crid=31LQTIQX0BT9E&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.DSpnoqQkRxfPKnzuDtT8Fw.-uvMcXXQ5tML_bClDktxhosxYzx4E3Lx8nJ9KYlhBdg&dib_tag=se&keywords=giordano+nakanishi&qid=1739722359&sprefix=giordano+nakanishi">*Computational Physics*, 2nd edition</a>.

### Course Format
The course will consist of brief lectures, discussion, and collaborative, learner-centered classroom activities designed to engage you actively in the learning process.  There will also be many in-class opportunities to practice both the physics and the computational techniques.

| BEFORE CLASS |DURING CLASS | AFTER CLASS|

### Grade Components

| Component | Description|
|---|---|
|Homework & In-Class Activities|A variety of homework will be assigned approximately once per week in order to help reinforce the material we discuss in class.  In addition, I will give occasional quizzes to make sure you are building competence.  Late homework submissions will not be accepted without prior approval from the instructor.  |
|Activities & Labs|We will start shorter activities and longer labs during class time.  You will often need to finish these outside of class. |
|Midterm Project |This will be an individual project that you will complete over the course of several weeks. |
|Midterm Exam |This will consist of an in-class written portion as well as a coding portion that will be done during class.|
|Final Project |This will be an individual project on a topic of your choosing.  More details to follow!|
|Final Exam |This will be a cumulative exam that will include both a written and coding component.  For the final exam, students will be allowed to bring an 8.5 by 11 inch sheet of paper containing any information they please, using both sides.|
